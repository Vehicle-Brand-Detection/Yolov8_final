## Introduction

Welcome to our project! We're on a mission to make cars safer and more efficient by using a smart tool. We're combining two cool technologies, YOLOv8 and Streamlit, to make a web app that can recognize car brands in real-time.

## What We Want to Achieve

Imagine a world where a computer can look at a car and instantly know its brand. That's what we're aiming for. We also want to count how many cars there are of each brand.

## Our Goals

Here's what we're trying to do:

1. **Real-Time Detection:** We want to show you how to make a computer quickly figure out what car brands are in a video.

2. **Counting Cars:** We'll also teach you how to count how many cars there are for each brand.

3. **Easy Web App:** We're using Streamlit to make it easy for anyone to use this tech, even if you're not a computer whiz.

## Why We Chose YOLOv8

YOLOv8 is a super smart tool that's great at recognizing things. It's perfect for figuring out car brands quickly.

## Why We Chose Streamlit

Streamlit is like a magic wand for making easy-to-use web apps. Even if you're new to coding, you can make a great app with it.

## Let's Get Started!

Are you excited to make cars smarter and safer? Jump into our guide and join us on this cool journey. Together, we'll make our vision of smarter cars a reality with YOLOv8 and Streamlit!

Happy coding and car brand detecting!
